# FiveM hud (ESX compatible only)
This is a FiveM made with an idea for a RP server. It might look trash and outdated, because nopixel 1.0 had the same hud, but for me it was one of the best huds I saw, so I came up with an idea to remake this hud in react.js as a learning material.

##How I can start developing it?

Simply run 

```
npm install
```

inside UI folder to install required packages and use

```
npm run start
```

to start a developement server

```
npm run build
```

To build a production version of UI
